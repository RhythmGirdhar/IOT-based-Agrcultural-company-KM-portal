	<p> Farmapp began in 2014 as a digital IPM (Integrated Pest Management) solution. Founded by Luis Eduardo Ortiz (Mechanical Engineer with great experience in Agritech projects) and myself (an Electronic Engineer with over 15 years in software and IoT development), we were both looking to integrate technology into the agricultural industry.<br>

Farmapp started operations in Colombia in 2015, supporting flower growers with the management of pests and diseases. Colombia, the second largest producer of flowers in the world, allowed us to develop Farmapp side by side with the most important players in the industry and with the highest standards.<br>
There is an increasing problem in developing countries; they are considered the pantry of the world but there is no strict control over the use of pesticides and/or the management of pests and diseases. High demand for products makes this practice very polluting for the environment and humans. Additionally, this is one of the causes of the low profitability of the agricultural sector in these countries. Pest and disease monitoring, spraying control, climate management and crop production estimates are agricultural lines that are treated very empirically and often in a manual, low-tech way.<br>
